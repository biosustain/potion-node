### Installation
----------------
Install this package with [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com):
```bash
$(node bin)/npm install potion-client
```

Or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en):
```bash
yarn install potion-client
```

It can also be used with [JSPM](http://jspm.io):
```bash
$(npm bin)/jspm install potion=npm:potion-client
```


### Usage
---------
Before you use this package, make sure you include [reflect-metadata](https://www.npmjs.com/package/reflect-metadata) and a shim for ES6/7 features ([core-js](https://github.com/zloirock/core-js) has the most comprehensive collection of shims and I advise using it).

Furthermore, this package has multiple implementations available, it can be used with:
* [Fetch](docs/FETCH.md), using [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) (make sure to include a polyfill such as [whatwg-fetch](https://github.com/github/fetch) if you are targeting a browser that does not implement the API);
* [Angular](docs/ANGULAR.md);
* [AngularJS](docs/ANGULARJS.md).

**IMPORTANT**: All resource properties that are retrieved from the backend will be converted from snake case to camel case, so the following:
```python
class Foo(db.Model):
    bar_name = db.Column(db.String(256), nullable=True)
```
Will match the following resource on the client side:
```ts
class Foo extends Item {
    barName: string;
}
```


### Contribute
--------------
If you'd like to contribute:
1. Clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/biosustain/potion-node`;
2. Install all the deps `yarn install`/`npm install`. 

Now you can start hacking :)

Before you make a pull request, you can check if builds and tests will run successfully:
1. Run the tests using `npm run test` (*if you wish to run tests on file change, use `npm run test:continuous`*);
2. Use `npm run build` to build the `.ts` files and see if any errors have occurred.

If you're a contributor and you wish to publish the package, use the release scripts from `package.json`. 

For example, if you wish to publish a patch, use:
```bash
npm run release
```

**NOTE**: Do not forget to `git push --follow-tags` when you push, otherwise tags might not be pushed (depending on your Git global config).

The `master` branch will publish to the `latest` tag, whereas the `next` branch will publish to the `next` tag on NPM.
This can be useful for making pre releases or major changes and allowing users to test the lib,
but not break apps depending on the latest version.

As a rule of thumb, you should **always** make a pre release only in the `next` branch,
allowing for publishing the stable version from the `master` branch:
```bash
# Make a patch pre release so that:
# 1.0.0 -> 1.0.1-0
# using:
npm run release:prerelease
# NOTE: Subsequent runs of the command above,
# will result in: 1.0.1-1, 1.0.1-2, etc.

# Make a major pre release so that:
# 1.0.0 -> 2.0.0-0
# using:
npm run release:premajor
# From there on,
# to increment the pre release version so that:
# 2.0.0-0 -> 2.0.0-1
# use:
npm run release:prerelease
```
